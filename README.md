This is an example of the results from an asymmetry analysis of the FAERS database, which includes the results of the conventional proportion imbalance method, frequency method, Bayesian method, and proportion imbalance signals at each level of MedDRA (PT, HLGT, HLT, SOC, SMQ). It also includes the results of various subgroup stratified analyses. We can provide a comprehensive solution for FAERS database analysis. Email: fastsignal@faers.vip
